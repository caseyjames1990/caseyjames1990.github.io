    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>In 2015 at age 25, I founded a logistics brokerage that managed freight operations for commercial manufacturers across the U.S. I built the company from the ground up, growing it from zero to $10 million in annual revenue. After a successful sale in 2021–2022, I’ve focused exclusively on investing in public equities.</p>
